        <h1>Privacy Policy for TriggerFill</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 12/6/2024</p>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>At TriggerFill, your privacy is our priority. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when you use our browser extension. By installing or using TriggerFill, you agree to the terms of this policy.</p>

        <h2>What Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>TriggerFill does not collect, transmit, or share any personal information. All data used by the extension is stored locally on your device or within Chrome’s storage system. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Trigger Data:</strong> User-defined trigger words and their corresponding expanded text are stored locally using Chrome's <code>storage</code> API.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <p>The data stored by TriggerFill is used solely to enable its core functionality: automatically filling forms with your saved trigger words. No data is transmitted to external servers or shared with third parties.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>TriggerFill does not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties. The extension operates entirely on your device, ensuring that your information stays private.</p>

        <h2>Security of Your Data</h2>
        <p>We take steps to ensure the data saved by TriggerFill remains secure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is stored locally or within Chrome's secure storage system.</li>
            <li>If Chrome Sync is enabled, your data may be backed up to your Google account, subject to Google's privacy policies.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>User Control</h2>
        <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add, edit, or delete trigger words directly in the extension’s options.</li>
            <li>Uninstalling the extension will permanently delete all data stored by it.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>TriggerFill does not integrate with or use any third-party services for data processing or storage.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Please review this policy periodically to stay informed about how we handle your data.</p>
